I chose this program from openprocessing because I am interested in the process of procedural generation to artificially replicate natural or pleasing structures. I hope to use it as a creative problem solving tool for asset creation, environment creation, and other things that can be uniquely generated in an interesting and unpredictable manner. The 2D map seems like a relatively easier starting point, but I would be interested in uniquely generating 3D assets and terrains especially.
